<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ttending an all boys school, followed by engineering at university I grew up mainly working on male-only teams. High school and university group projects, basketball, rugby union and later software teams I got a fair dose of the difference between having only males on the team, and the benefits female team members would immediately bring.</p>

In my case this included:

* Better sociability.
* More focus on team outcomes. 
* More fun (thanks Eily).

Working with great female leaders has also helped me learn more about my own strengths and weaknesses. Receiving encouragement and constructive criticism happened much sooner and more frequently in my engagement with these leaders relative to my earlier career. This ensured I had a chance to grow my skills both technically and socially as quickly as I would listen to the advice (thanks Robina and Janet).  
 
Given my own experiences in the area I was keen to see if there was research on the matter. Fortunately Vivian Giang had gathered numerous research points on [competition at work](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/teams-more-productive-than-individuals-2013-8) and suggests:

>Women were more likely to choose team-based pay and often avoided tournaments. This choice had the opposite effect on men

Giang sights the [published study](http://papers.nber.org/tmp/50510-w19277.pdf) by Pete Kuhn which suggests:

>men tend to be overconfident in their skills and are “more pessimistic than women about the abilities of their potential teammates"

Kuhn explains that the nature of work has changed and has to be more cooperative to be successful. He indicates individuals need to come together to compete with other companies rather then competing with each other internally. In his study he also found: 

>offer[ing] participants a 10% increase in pay to join a team instead of working solo, more men joined teams. Interestingly, women tended to choose teams even if it paid less than working individually.


This research ties in nicely with my own experiences with teams. Men tend to be more willing to take on challenges outside their existing ability (i.e. be overconfident) but where less inclined to trust team mates and quickly form teams. Women on the teams counter this with focusing on the teams and drawing from the over-confidence of the men to take on challenges. With the right kind of incentives, encouragement and taking the lead from women; men will put more energy into the teamwork while still taking on greater challenges. 

**With gender diversity, woman help make better teams.** Shana Lebowitz delves into this topic in her article - [Why men and women make the best office teams](http://www.learnvest.com/2014/12/work-it-why-men-and-women-make-the-best-office-teams-123/). She singles out the business benefit of gender diverse teams:

>...gender diversity was a huge boon to the company’s bottom line—so much so that researchers estimated that transitioning from a single-gender office to an office evenly split between men and women would translate to a whopping 41% revenue gain—a finding that’s backed up by other recent [research](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/166220/business-benefits-gender-diversity.aspx), suggesting gender diversity is good for business.

Getting to the why of gender-diversity, Derek Thompson writes about the non-verbal skills of women in his article - [The Secret to Smart Groups: It's Women](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/the-secret-to-smart-groups-isnt-smart-people/384625/)
>Women are better at reading the mind through the face, even online, when they can't see their teammates' faces.

Rapidly getting to know their colleagues through things like body language is a clear advantage to women in building trust and ultimately teams. **So how do men contribute and what is the drawback ?**

Roisin Donnelly explains the balancing attributes in her article 
[Women take things personally and men don't listen - together they make the best teams](http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1284909/women-things-personally-men-dont-listen-together-best-teams).She speaks of the studies conducted by [Dr Pat Heim](http://www.heimgroup.com/index.php/about/history) on the synergy of men and women:

>Girls spend most of their time playing with small groups of other girls and building relationships...
>Meanwhile, boys are playing with bigger teams of other boys in win/lose or team games

Robson through Dr Heim's work points out that women have an advantage in their communication and interpersonal skills but don't always focus on the goal and can take losing too personally. Men on the other hand are good at focusing on goals but not are good at listening to colleagues and customers.

### So how can you make the best teams?

 1. **Get and keep your teams "gender diverse"** - find ways to attract a balance of women and men on your teams. The improved balance between cooperation and competition will make it worth the effort.
 2. **Create team incentives** - women who are already tend towards team work will be rewarded and men will be encouraged to engage in teamwork of individual gain.
 3. **Be aware of over/under confidence**. Understand the skills of your team members and be sure to help facilitate women who may not take on more risk balanced with men who take on too much.
