<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he virtues of team work appeared fairly early in my career - working on a prototype presentation with a large transport company meant we had to scramble a small team of six to get 6 months work done in two weeks. 
<p>

Suffice to say the product was not high quality but did a great job for the presentation. None of this would have been remotely possible without the work of the team, working around the clock and cheerleading each other along to get the crucial pieces working. 

**So teams are always the best way to work - right ?**
This is what I have always thought - but we have lots of examples in our society that counter this. CEOs, quarterbacks, authors are all paid handsomely to work their individual magic. Mark Zuckerberg has even been famously [quoted](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/technology/18talent.html)

> Someone who is exceptional in their role is not just a little better than someone who is pretty good,” he said. “They are 100 times better.

This sentiment is taken to the extreme with a industry trend known as acqhiring  ([Bill Taylor explains in his article](https://hbr.org/2011/06/great-people-are-overrated)).

> acqhiring - shelling out big bucks to acquire a company, not to buy a product or a piece of technology, but to hire a few (or even one) software programmer or engineer who will arrive at the acquiring company and make a huge impact

In the same article Bill offers the counter point regarding a sudden decline in a star's who changes teams. 

>star analysts who change firms suffer an immediate and lasting decline in performance. Their earlier excellence appears to have depended heavily on their former firms’ general and proprietary resources, organisational cultures, networks, and colleagues

**Sounds like teams are still crucial as high performing individuals still heavily depend on their team.** 

This becomes even clearer when you look at sport. Peak sports team performance requires each player to be focused, hard-working and ambitious - often resulting in being hard-to-manage. Individually competing to "gain inches" can lead to a win - these efforts can often challenge personal relationships as the need to win for the team gets ahead of passing to your colleague.

My own experience in teams at work has seen similar challenges appear - particularly around **domain knowledge**. Just because you know how to do it and can do it the quickest - is it healthy for the team if you are the **only** one who does it ? "That's not her role or job title....he is a coder why is he facilitating a meeting...how can you risk having Marcos involved". Sound familiar ? 

Watching various all-star sports games has time and time-again shown that a great team can overcome an almighty collection of individuals. Even the original US Dream Team was beaten in 1992 by a [team of college stars](http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/the-dream-teams-very-bad-day/?_r=0).

Mark de Rond [writing for Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/05/teams-teamwork-individuals-leadership-managing-collaboration.html) speaks to this situation. 

>...it is not true that the best teams are made up of the best individuals...it makes sense to sacrifice competence in favor of sociability


Looking further into the counter point of view, [Jeff Stibel explores brain biology](https://hbr.org/2011/06/why-a-great-individual-is-bett).

>The truth is, our brains work very well individually but tend to break down in groups. This is why we have individual decision makers in business (and why paradoxically we have group decisions in government)

Jeff also goes further to say contributions from great individual are at risk of mediocre minds. Passing Michelangelo’s work onto another artist would not yield the same perfection.

However to counter to point of operating in isolation Jeff does conclude with: 

>Leaders need to make tough decisions all the time. One decision is easy: find the best people and empower them to do great things.

## How to strike the balance?

1. **Teams and great individuals are a symbiotic relationship**. Great individuals struggle to  perform the same great feats without the teams that support them. Likewise a team without great individuals won't deliver results. Building a chemistry that supports both without a tradeoff in one direction works the best.

2. **Great individuals are volatile and need team support** - performing at peak can lead to individuals to "run hot" and ultimately "run cold". Having a suitable team to cover the low periods and provide emotional support can ensure a [rectifying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier) effect - similar to alternating current to direct current power conversion. 

3. **Ensure a great skills include sociability**. The key to the evolution of our knowledge has been the ability to socialise. This is exactly the same in teams. Be a great individual but be sure to be able to share those skills and achievements with others who will help to you to even greater heights.
