### Profesional blurb

Scott is a problem solver and product engineering leader, experienced in leading teams to design, model and implement high-performance software solutions. I have over 20 years experience with teams, including remote teams in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Specialising in user-friendly internet, mobile and desktop solutions. Regularly engaged in all phases of the product and engineering lifecycle, from initial business requirements, project inceptions, software architecture (IEEE 1471) through to prototype development, implementation, and maintenance. I am effective at working in and building teams with an emphasis on ephemeral results, intuition, creativity, empathy - but most of all fun.

*Leadership* - coaching, managing and providing direction for team leaders, independent contributors and technical product managers. Focused on autonomous, agile teams that deliver timely and relevant results.
Transformation - regularly working on, and in teams involved in new tools, techniques, brand integrations and digital disruption.

*Innovation* - facilitating and engaging in the use of rapid test and learn feedback cycles and the scientific method.

*Strategy* - working closely with my c-level peers, product directors, user experience/interface designers/researchers, marketing, search engine optimisation specialists and retail teams to realise candidate solutions. Leveraging data science for discovery and confirmation of delivery.

*Execution* - efficient and effective delivery of prototypes and candidate solutions. Leading and working with peers to coordinate significant program delivery.

*Relationships* - working with governance teams for structured communication. Also focused on ad hoc organic contact with senior leaders (VPs, Directors, Managers and others leaders) to create and maintain powerful relationships.

*Change Management and Facilitation* - in senior roles as Wotif, Expedia and Nimble I have worked to optimise teams for their strengths and success. This process has involved consultation and structured planning to ensure fair and fast outcomes.
